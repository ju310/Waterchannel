# Bathymetry Reconstruction in a Water Channel

## Description
This code reconstructs the bathymetry in a water channel using either simulated or experimental observation data. We use gradient descent to minimise an objective functional, where we compute the numerical solution of the continuous adjoint problem in order to determine the gradient. The forward problem is modelled by the nonlinear nonrotating shallow water equations and discretised with the spectral methods framework [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/).

## How to reproduce the data and plots
After cloning this repository, download the measurement data from the water flume [here](https://doi.org/10.15480/882.9601). You can compute and save the mean of the measurements by uncommenting the lower lines in `compare_observations.py`. This file will also produce the plots of the means with confidence intervals.
### Solutions of the SWE
- Go to the file `ProblemRelatedFiles/Compute_channel_forward.py`.
- Set variables as needed. In particular, set `save = True`. To obtain the plots in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2024.106321), you may copy the parameters from [sim_data_Tiefe=0,3_A=40_F=0,35_meanBathy_ExactRamp_T=12_M=128.txt](./ProblemRelatedFiles/WaterchannelData/sim_data_Tiefe=0,3_A=40_F=0,35_meanBathy_ExactRamp_T=12_M=128.txt).
- Execute the file.
### Plots of the solution of the SWE
- Go to the file `create_plots_forward.py`.
- Insert the file name that was generated by `ProblemRelatedFiles/Compute_channel_forward.py`.
- Set `save = True`.
- Execute the file.
### Optimisation results
If you want to generate the optimisation results, use the file gradient_descent.py as follows.
- Set `useOtherParams = True` if you want to reproduce the data from the paper.
- If you set `useOtherParams = True`: Set `folder` to one of the folders with parameters, e.g. `sim_obs_sensor_pos`.
- If you don't want to use one of the predefined parameter files, change the indicated variables in `ProblemRelatedFiles/params.py` as needed.
- Set `save = True`.
- Execute the file `gradient_descent.py`.
### Plots of the bathymetry reconstruction etc.
- Go to the file `create_plots.py`.
- Insert the folder name that contains the hdf5 file with the optimisation data (e.g. 2024_02_22_09_12_AM).
- Set `save = True`.
- Execute the file.
### Plot of the bathymetry
- Execute the file `plot_bathymetry.py`.
- Optional: Uncomment the code lines at the bottom to save the figure.
