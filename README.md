# Bathymetry Reconstruction in a Water Channel

## Description
This code reconstructs the bathymetry in a water channel using either simulated or experimental observation data. We use gradient descent to minimise an objective functional, where we compute the numerical solution of the continuous adjoint problem in order to determine the gradient. The forward problem is modelled by the nonlinear nonrotating shallow water equations and discretised with the spectral methods framework [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/).

## How to reproduce the data and plots
After cloning this repository, download the measurement data from the water flume here (link to be added). You can compute and save the mean of the measurements by uncommenting the lower lines in `compare_observations.py`. This file will also produce the plots of the means with confidence intervals.
### Solutions of the SWE
- Go to the file `ProblemRelatedFiles/Compute_channel_forward.py`.
- Set variables as needed. In particular, set `save = True`. To obtain the plots in the paper (link to be added), you may copy the parameters from [nobathyTiefe=0,3_A=40_F=0,35_mean_kappa2e-01_T=13.txt](./ProblemRelatedFiles/WaterchannelData/nobathyTiefe=0,3_A=40_F=0,35_mean_kappa2e-01_T=13.txt) and [sim_data_Tiefe=0,3_A=40_F=0,35_meanBathy_ExactRamp_T=13.txt](./ProblemRelatedFiles/WaterchannelData/sim_data_Tiefe=0,3_A=40_F=0,35_meanBathy_ExactRamp_T=13.txt).
- Execute the file.
### Plots of the solution of the SWE
- Go to the file `create_plots_forward.py`.
- Insert the file name that was generated by `ProblemRelatedFiles/Compute_channel_forward.py`.
- Set `save = True`.
- Execute the file.
### Optimisation results
We provide the hdf5 files with optimisation data here (Link still to be added). If you want to compute those yourself, use the file gradient_descent.py as follows.
- Set `save = True`.
- In `ProblemRelatedFiles/params.py` change the indicated variables as needed.
- Execute the file `gradient_descent.py`.
### Plots of the bathymetry reconstruction etc.
- Go to the file `create_plots.py`.
- Insert the folder name that was generated by the file `gradient_descent.py` (e.g. 2024_02_22_09_12_AM).
- Set `save = True`.
- Execute the file.
### Plot of the bathymetry
- Execute the file `plot_bathymetry.py`.
- Optional: Uncomment the code lines at the bottom to save the figure.

## Requirements
Installation of [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html) version 3.0.0 or newer is required. For the versions of NumPy, SciPy etc. see the file `requirements.txt`.
